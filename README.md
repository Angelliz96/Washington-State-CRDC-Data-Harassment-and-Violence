# Washington-State-CRDC-Data-Harassment-and-Violence
Analyzing harassment and violence in Washington State schools using CRDC data to identify trends, disparities, and insights for social impact.
Overview

This project uses data from the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), a biennial survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Since 1968, the CRDC has collected detailed information about student enrollment, educational programs, and services. Most of the data is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, disability status, and English language proficiency.

This dataset focuses specifically on harassment and violence indicators for schools in Washington State. It provides insights into reported incidents and allows for analysis of disparities and patterns across demographic groups.
